# Dynamic documents



# R Markdown to HTML


# htmlwidgets

## Web-native visualisations

<br> 

There are a growing number of R packages that make it easy to create interactive/web native visualisations.

Many of these are based on a framework called htmlwidgets.

## Leaflet

```{r message=FALSE}
library(leaflet); library(dplyr)

leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% fitBounds(0, 40, 10, 50)
```

## networkD3

```{r}
library(networkD3); data(MisLinks); data(MisNodes)

forceNetwork(Links = MisLinks, Nodes = MisNodes, Source = "source",
             Target = "target", Value = "value", NodeID = "name",
             Group = "group", opacity = 0.7, zoom = TRUE)
```
